# Not your father's UIWebView

If you're building an application taking advantage of web views, you'll want to learn about the new technologies available in the WebKit framework.

In this session you'll learn how to use WKWebView as a drop-in replacement for UIWebView, inject user scripts to add and modify behavior, use script handlers to call back into native code from JavaScript, and use HTML5 for rapid prototyping.

Note: This session uses APIs introduced in iOS 8.0 and OS X Yosemite. To use the sample code you will need to have a copy of Xcode 6 beta on your Mac, which is now available with a free Apple Developer account.
