This repository includes files for my presentation(s) at [CocoaConf](http://cocoaconf.com/), the developer conference for those who think different.

In addition to these resources, you can also read my blog at [wjlafrance.net](http://www.wjlafrance.net) where I blog about software development and other stuff.
